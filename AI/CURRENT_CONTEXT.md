# Current Context

## Authority and operating model

```text
OWNER: final product, UAT, merge and release authority
DESIGN_DIAGNOSIS_AUTHORITY: GPT Web + Owner
IMPLEMENTATION_PROVIDERS: GPT direct (bounded) / US Codex CLI (frozen low-medium complexity) / US Claude Code (complex-high ambiguity)
PRIMARY_IMPLEMENTATION_HOST: US Mac
PRIMARY_FULL_VERIFICATION_HOST: US Mac
OWNER_UAT_HOST: US Mac local/remote UAT
CHINA_VERIFICATION: special-case only unless Owner explicitly requests it or a concrete cross-machine/region-specific defect requires it
SOURCE_OF_TRUTH: GitHub / beyourlovercom/erpbeyourlovercom
REMOTE_MILESTONE_TARGET: https://erp.beyourlover.com
```

GitHub remains the unique synchronization/source-of-truth path. Remote Production deployment is milestone-gated and is not part of normal development debugging.

## Canonical baseline through PR #110

```text

## Current program position

```text
CURRENT_PROGRAM_PHASE: KOL V1 FULL COMPLETION TRACK
CURRENT_WORK_PACKAGE: ERP-GOV-ROADMAP-RECONCILIATION-001 / MERGE GATE
CURRENT_PRODUCT_WORK_PACKAGE: NONE UNTIL ROADMAP RECONCILIATION MERGES
NEXT_PRODUCT_WORK_PACKAGE: ERP-KOL-M1.2A-COLLABORATION-001
```

Owner selected the KOL track on 2026-08-28. The program now stays on KOL until KOL V1 is fully implemented, regression-tested and Owner-UAT stable.

Frozen KOL completion order:

```text
ERP-KOL-M1.2A-COLLABORATION-001
→ ERP-KOL-M1.2B-FULFILLMENT-BRIDGE-001
→ ERP-KOL-M1.3-CONTENT-001
→ ERP-KOL-M1.4-FINANCE-AFFILIATE-001
→ ERP-KOL-V1-CROSS-PHASE-CLOSURE-001
```

MVP2 fulfillment intelligence and ERP-INQUIRY-M1.2 remain paused while this KOL completion track is active.

## Canonical truth ownership

```text
KOL = KOL master + CRM + Collaboration + Content + KOL finance projections
PRODUCT = products.id / SKU
INVENTORY = Warehouse + SKU×Warehouse stock truth
ORDER = orders.id
SHIPMENT = fulfillment / carrier / service / tracking truth
SYNC = external synchronization orchestration/evidence
AFFILIATEWP = Affiliate / Referral / Payout provider truth
```

No module may create a second truth for another module's canonical entity.

## KOL / Fulfillment boundary

KOL M1.2 is split to prevent duplicate fulfillment logic:

```text
M1.2A Collaboration
M1.2B Canonical Fulfillment Bridge
```

M1.2A owns formal cooperation facts. If physical sample/product fulfillment is required, M1.2B creates or links the existing canonical Order using `order_kind=kol_fulfillment`, then projects existing Shipment/Tracking state back into the KOL collaboration view.

KOL must not implement its own Inventory, Reservation, warehouse allocation, Shipment, Tracking, shipping-cost, transport-mode, carrier-rule or Warehouse Connector engine.

## Global Fulfillment roadmap retained

```text
MVP2   Inventory Reservation Foundation
MVP2.1 Warehouse Allocation Recommendation
MVP2.2 Packing + Chargeable Weight
MVP2.3 Shipping Cost Estimator
MVP2.4 Transport Mode Decision / Express-to-Ocean Evaluation
MVP2.5 Carrier Rule Engine
MVP3   Warehouse Connector Foundation + real warehouse adapters
MVP4   Automatic Fulfillment
```

Future chargeable weight remains `max(actual_weight, volumetric_weight)`. Express cost above the configurable threshold triggers ocean evaluation, not forced ocean.

## Open Draft classification

```text
PR #97 Entity Architecture V2: RETAIN / DESIGN REFERENCE ONLY / NOT EXECUTION AUTHORITY
PR #81 Dashboard pilot: RETAIN AS LEGACY EXPERIMENT / STALE BASELINE / NOT ROADMAP AUTHORITY
PR #98 Roadmap Rebaseline: CLOSED / SUPERSEDED
PR #109 duplicate KOL CRM: CLOSED / SUPERSEDED BY PR #110
```

## Verification / release gates

```text
NORMAL DEVELOPMENT: US Mac
NORMAL OWNER UAT: US Mac local/remote UAT
CHINA: NOT REQUIRED BY DEFAULT
GITHUB: UNIQUE SOURCE OF TRUTH
REMOTE URL: https://erp.beyourlover.com
REMOTE USE: STABLE MILESTONE RELEASE ONLY
PRODUCTION DIRECT EDIT: FORBIDDEN
```

## Immediate sequence

```text
1. Deliver ERP-GOV-ROADMAP-RECONCILIATION-001 as docs/governance only.
2. Apply `BYL_ERP_CONTINUOUS_OWNER_AUTHORIZATION_V1`: once applicable Owner UAT/checks are satisfied, merge routine in-scope delivery without a separate merge-authorization prompt.
3. After merge, Owner chooses exactly one next bounded product track.
4. No stale Draft PR may override the merged main roadmap.
5. No KOL work may duplicate canonical Product / Inventory / Order / Shipment / Tracking truth.
```
