# Work Package Index

## Current authority overlay — 2026-09-19

Canonical current program status is `28_ERP_ROADMAP_PRODUCTION_RECONCILIATION_V3.md`.

All `Status:` fields below are historical package evidence unless they are consistent with later merged GitHub facts. In particular, old `CURRENT`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `PR_PENDING`, `READY_FOR_PRODUCTION`, and `MERGE_READY` markers must not be used to reopen work already closed by later PRs.

Current closed foundations include KOL V1, Product OS core, Purchase OS V1, Customer OS core, Logistics OS V1, Accounting P8 and Accounting P9. Current repair priority is source-of-truth cleanup, Production timestamp catch-up audit, MySQL Continuous Delta fixture normalization, Warehouse provider coverage, and accounting evidence completeness.
