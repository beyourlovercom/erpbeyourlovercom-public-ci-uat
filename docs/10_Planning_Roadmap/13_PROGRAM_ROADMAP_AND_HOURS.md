# Program Roadmap and Hours

## V3 current-status overlay — 2026-09-19

This overlay supersedes older mutable `CURRENT_*` markers and the 2026-09-05 V2 overlay below while preserving them as historical planning records. Canonical current status is `28_ERP_ROADMAP_PRODUCTION_RECONCILIATION_V3.md`.

Current strategic line: **GitHub / Production Truth Reconciliation → Production Stability + Historical Catch-up Audit → Warehouse real-bill coverage → Inventory/Fulfillment automation hardening → Accounting completeness**.

KOL V1, Product OS core, Purchase OS V1, Customer OS core, Logistics OS V1, Accounting P8 and Accounting P9 are closed at their frozen scopes. Current work must not reopen those foundations without a bounded regression.


This document is the repository source of truth for the complete Program Roadmap, estimate classifications, known and unknown remaining hours, actual-hours evidence and no-double-counting rules.

```

The Program Roadmap is the top-level delivery sequence. It must not be replaced by the current Architecture track or a single Work Package map.

## Fulfillment planning principle

```text
MVP1 = MANUAL DECISIONS / ERP REPLACES TENCENT DOCS
MVP2 = ASSISTED INTELLIGENCE / HUMAN CONFIRMATION
MVP3 = WAREHOUSE CONNECTORS
MVP4 = AUTOMATIC FULFILLMENT
```

MVP1 must not be expanded by pulling future intelligent judgment into the current delivery. The long-term interfaces must remain compatible with Reservation, warehouse recommendation, Packing, chargeable weight, shipping-cost estimation, transport-mode evaluation, carrier rules and WMS connectors. Future chargeable weight uses `max(actual_weight, volumetric_weight)`. Future express cost above the configurable threshold (initial business threshold 300, currency configurable) triggers ocean-freight evaluation and does not force ocean automatically.

## Source Conflict Snapshot

```text
GITHUB_FACT: PR #101, #104, #106, #108, #103 and #110 are merged; the old roadmap positions that listed those phases as future/current are stale.
CANONICAL_MAIN_FACT: merged main is the only execution authority after this reconciliation; draft PRs cannot supersede it.
FULFILLMENT_TRUTH_FACT: Product, Inventory, Order, Shipment and Tracking truth already exist in their canonical modules.
KOL_BOUNDARY_FACT: KOL may own Collaboration facts and project fulfillment state, but must not own a second Order/Shipment/Inventory/Tracking engine.
KOL_FULFILLMENT_FACT: KOL physical fulfillment uses canonical orders.id with order_kind=kol_fulfillment and existing Shipment/Tracking truth.
INQUIRY_FACT: M1.2 Contact remains PAUSED / NOT CANCELLED until explicit Owner reactivation.
ENTITY_ARCH_FACT: PR #97 remains a docs/design reference only and is not implementation authority.
STALE_PR_FACT: PR #98 roadmap rebaseline and PR #109 duplicate KOL CRM are CLOSED / superseded by later merged facts.
VERIFICATION_FACT: US Mac remains the default sufficient verification/UAT host; China is special-case only unless explicitly requested or required by a concrete issue.
CURRENT_FACT: Roadmap Reconciliation is docs-only; no product feature is active after it until Owner selects a bounded next Work Package.
EVIDENCE_LIMITS: Production deployment, live WMS connectors and remote production mutation remain outside this reconciliation.
```

## Current Program Position and Estimate

```text
TOTAL_ARCHITECTURE_MIGRATION_REMAINING: 0h / complete
ACTUAL_HOURS: UNKNOWN WITH EVIDENCE
INVENTORY_M1: COMPLETE / OWNER UAT PASS / MERGED BY PR #96
CURRENT_PACKAGE: NONE / Inventory M1 closed
CURRENT_PACKAGE_BASELINE: current main / see GitHub for exact SHA
NEXT_PACKAGE: ERP-KOL-M1.2A-COLLABORATION-001 / OWNER SELECTED KOL V1 FULL COMPLETION
MVP1_MANUAL_FULFILLMENT_INTEGRATION: COMPLETE / MERGED BY PR #101 / historical, not remaining
POST_MVP_SMART_FULFILLMENT_ESTIMATE: UNKNOWN WITH EVIDENCE / Reservation, Allocation, Packing, Cost, Mode, Carrier, Connectors and Automation are separately bounded future work
ERP_INQUIRY_M1_ESTIMATE: 86–150h / planning value 116h / frozen M1.0 contract; M1.1 complete; M1.2–M1.9 retained
ERP_INQUIRY_M1_1_COMPANY_ESTIMATE: 6–10h / planning value 8h / completed package estimate, not remaining
ERP_INQUIRY_M1_2_CONTACT_ESTIMATE: retained inside approved ERP-INQUIRY-M1 milestone / execution PAUSED
MVP1_HUMAN_UAT_FINDINGS_OPEN: retained until individually evidenced closed
REMOTE_DEPLOYMENT: NO / milestone gated
```

No exact estimate is issued for MVP1 Manual Fulfillment Integration until its bounded Work Package defines the remaining manual Order/Product/Inventory/Logistics connection scope. Smart fulfillment phases remain separately estimated later and must not be pulled into MVP1. Chat elapsed time must not be converted into an estimate.

Historical architecture estimate fields below remain historical/completed evidence and are not current remaining work.

## Initial Hours Snapshot

| Metric | Value | Classification | Evidence / Qualification |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `001D_TOTAL_ESTIMATE` | 35–54h; planning value 45h | completed issued total estimate | Frozen and completed parent 001D package; not remaining |
| `001E_PARENT_PLANNING_ESTIMATE` | 40–62h; planning value 51h | parent-level original planning estimate | Original allocation across 001E-A/B/C; not remaining |
| `001E_B_CONFIRMED_ESTIMATE` | 12–18h; planning value 15h | confirmed child implementation estimate | Accepted bounded implementation estimate; package merged and closed |
| `001F_B2_TO_B5_KNOWN_ESTIMATE` | 4–8 Codex / 20–40h; planning value 30h | historical planning estimate | completed architecture scope; not remaining |
| `001F_C_TO_001F_F_ESTIMATE` | SUPERSEDED / COMPLETE | historical planning estimate | 001F-C through 001F-F are closed; not a remaining estimate |
| `TOTAL_ARCHITECTURE_MIGRATION_REMAINING` | 0h / complete | remaining estimate | Global Architecture Gate is PASS and 001F is closed |
| `ACTUAL_HOURS` | UNKNOWN WITH EVIDENCE | actual-hours status | no fabricated actuals |
| `MVP1_TOTAL_ESTIMATE` | 122–190h | total estimate | Effective Hours source; not automatically remaining |
| `MVP1_PLANNING_BASELINE` | 166h | total planning value | Effective Hours source |
| `MVP1_MAXIMUM_ENVELOPE` | 192h | maximum total planning envelope | Living Roadmap and Effective Hours sources |
| `MVP1_REMAINING` | UNKNOWN WITH EVIDENCE | unknown remaining total | Accepted actual-hours ledger and proven architecture/MVP1 overlap map are incomplete |
| `ERP_ORDER_FULFILLMENT_M1_ESTIMATE` | UNKNOWN WITH EVIDENCE | historical completed package estimate | package is complete/merged; no retrospective range is fabricated |
| `ERP_INQUIRY_M1_ESTIMATE` | 86–150h; planning value 116h | milestone implementation estimate | Owner-approved M1.0 contract; M1.1 completed; M1.2–M1.9 retained and paused only by priority |
| `ERP_INQUIRY_M1_1_COMPANY_ESTIMATE` | 6–10h; planning value 8h | completed child estimate | M1.1 Company merged by PR #89; do not count as remaining |
| `POST_MVP_KNOWN_INCREMENT` | approximately 68–120h beyond MVP1 | incremental estimate | WooCommerce inbound plus single outbound |
| `PROGRAM_REMAINING` | UNKNOWN WITH EVIDENCE | unknown remaining total | Long-term ranges are cumulative; actuals, overlap mapping and the current package estimate are incomplete |
| `COMPLETED_ACTUAL_EFFECTIVE_HOURS` | UNKNOWN WITH EVIDENCE | unknown actual effort | Accepted Work Logs do not yet provide a complete project-wide ledger; chat memory is not evidence |

## Long-Term Cumulative Ranges

| Milestone | Cumulative Estimate |
|---|---:|
| Architecture foundation | 235–402h |
| First highly automated operations MVP | 603–1,018h |
| Product/SEO growth layer | 1,059–1,802h |
| Full core ERP | 1,595–2,714h |
| All expansion | 1,819–3,146h |

These are alternative cumulative horizons, not additive components. They must never be summed together or added to an increment already included in the selected horizon.

## Completed Actual-Hours Ledger

| WORK_PACKAGE | STATUS | ESTIMATED_EFFECTIVE_HOURS | ACTUAL_EFFECTIVE_HOURS | SCOPE_CLASSIFICATION | INCLUDED_IN_MVP1_TOTAL | EVIDENCE |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|---|---|

| ERP-ARCH-MIGRATION-001D-B | MERGED / PASS | 9–14h; planning value 12h | 3h | architecture component | UNKNOWN WITH EVIDENCE | Accepted 001D-B Work Log |
| ERP-ARCH-MIGRATION-001D-C | MERGED / PASS | 14–22h; planning value 18h | 4.8h | architecture component | UNKNOWN WITH EVIDENCE | Accepted 001D-C Work Log through remediation Head |
| ERP-ARCH-MIGRATION-001D | COMPLETE / PASS | 35–54h; planning value 45h | UNKNOWN WITH EVIDENCE | parent aggregate; do not add to component rows | UNKNOWN WITH EVIDENCE | 001D-A missing actual prevents safe parent aggregation |
| ERP-ARCH-MIGRATION-001E-A | MERGED / PASS | 16–24h; planning value 20h | 7.1h cumulative | architecture component | UNKNOWN WITH EVIDENCE | Accepted 001E-A Work Log including Preflight and implementation |
| ERP-LOCAL-ADMIN-BYPASS-001 | MERGED / PASS | 8–12h; planning value 10h | 4.3h implementation | supporting local-only package | NO | Accepted Local Admin Bypass Work Log |
| ERP-SHELL-ACCOUNT-DOCK-001 | MERGED / PASS | 5–8h; planning value 6.5h | 4.8h | supporting App Shell package | UNKNOWN WITH EVIDENCE | Accepted Account Dock Work Log; Owner visual acceptance PASS |
| ERP-MENU-BASELINE-001 | MERGED / PASS | 3–5h; planning value 4h | 3.2h | governance baseline | NO | Accepted Menu Baseline Work Log |
| Project-wide accepted ledger | INCOMPLETE | UNKNOWN WITH EVIDENCE | UNKNOWN WITH EVIDENCE | actual-effort ledger | UNKNOWN WITH EVIDENCE | Historical accepted packages and architecture/MVP1 overlap classification remain incomplete |

Future rows may be added only from accepted repository Work Logs. PR elapsed time, commit timestamps, token use and chat-only values are prohibited as actual-hours evidence.

## Calculation Rules

- identify every value as total, remaining, incremental, cumulative, planning value, range or actual effort;
- a total estimate is not a remaining estimate;
- calculate remaining effort only from accepted actuals and a documented non-overlapping scope map;
- never convert an unknown into zero;
- use `UNKNOWN WITH EVIDENCE` with checked sources, missing data and the unsafe operation explained;
- do not sum cumulative ranges;
- do not add an increment to a cumulative value when the increment is already included;
- the current package estimate must agree with its formal Work Package.

## Estimate Confidence

```text
HIGH: quoted repository total/cumulative historical ranges and Owner-frozen ERP-INQUIRY-M1 milestone range
MEDIUM: bounded completed child-package estimates with accepted scope evidence
LOW / UNKNOWN: next Owner-selected feature and post-MVP smart-fulfillment estimates until bounded Work Packages are issued; project/program remaining total
ESTIMATE_AS_OF: 2026-08-27
ESTIMATE_METHOD: repository source classification; no subtraction without accepted actuals; no addition of cumulative/overlapping ranges; no chat-time conversion
```
