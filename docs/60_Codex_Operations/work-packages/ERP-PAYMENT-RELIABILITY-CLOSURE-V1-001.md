DEPENDENCIES: P1.6.1 Payment Authority Gate; P1.6.2 Stale Pending Reconciliation; P1.7 Payment Observability; P1.8 Gateway Economics — all MERGED
PARALLEL_SAFE: YES
FOUNDATION_CHANGE_REQUIRED: NO
OWNER_AUTHORIZATION: continuous execution through UAT; Production remains unauthorized

## Goal

Close Payment Reliability P1 into one canonical, read-only closure surface and one frozen gateway ownership / Checkout handoff contract.

P1.9 does NOT change payment routing. It records and validates the result of P1.0-P1.8.

## Closure command

Add:
payments:reliability-closure

Options:
- --json
- --as-of=<UTC timestamp>
- --health-days=<1..30>, default 1
- --economics-days=<1..365>, default 30
- --limit=<safe anomaly detail limit>

The command composes:
- PaymentHealthPreviewService
- GatewayEconomicsPreviewService

No parallel alternative calculations are allowed.

## Final gateway ownership contract

This is operational ownership, not a ranking.

- primary_card:
  - owner: woocommerce_payments
  - normal_checkout: enabled
- apple_pay:
  - owner: woocommerce_payments
  - placement: cart_and_checkout_only
- google_pay:
  - owner: woocommerce_payments
  - placement: cart_and_checkout_only
- paypal_wallet:
  - owner: ppcp
  - normal_checkout: enabled
- klarna_bnpl:
  - owner: airwallex_klarna
  - normal_checkout: enabled
- local_payment_methods:
  - owner: woocommerce_payments
  - availability: capability_and_region_based
- card_hot_standby:
  - owner: cpsw_stripe_element
  - normal_checkout: hidden
  - purpose: controlled emergency fallback only
- paypal_card:
  - owner: ppcp_card
  - normal_checkout: hidden_candidate
- airwallex_card:
  - owner: airwallex_card
  - normal_checkout: hidden_candidate

Product page express payment remains disabled by Checkout Experience contract.
Cart / Checkout express payment remains capability-driven; do not hard-code device OS.

## Safety capabilities to declare

- Payment Authority Gate: implemented
- Stale Pending classifier / preview: implemented, read-only
- Payment Observability: implemented, read-only
- Gateway Economics: implemented, read-only
- actual gateway fee evidence:
  - WooPayments supported
  - Stripe supported
  - PayPal supported
  - Airwallex unavailable
- raw provider authorization-attempt stream: unavailable
- canonical webhook event store: unavailable
- dispute/chargeback cost evidence: unavailable

These gaps are explicit. They are not silently replaced by Woo order counts or the 3.5% accounting estimate.

## Closure runtime state

Derived from current read-only evidence:
- blocked:
  - fulfillment_payment_mismatch > 0; OR
  - duplicate transaction identity > 0; OR
  - Woo sync state failed/stale/missing; OR
  - either health/economics scan is truncated.
- review:
  - no blocked condition, but PaymentHealth state=warning or Woo sync partial.
- ready:
  - none of the above.

This runtime state is NOT a Production deploy authorization and NOT an election/ranking of gateways.

## Rollout gates

Expose:
- payment_authority_safety
- woo_inbound_sync
- stale_pending_review
- economics_evidence
- provider_telemetry_coverage
- production_schema
- production_backfill
- checkout_routing_change

production_schema:
- pending_external until explicit Production migration gate executes the additive migrations already merged from P1.6.1 and P1.8.

production_backfill:
- not_authorized / separate future gate.
- historical transaction id / actual fee refresh or backfill is not part of P1.9.

checkout_routing_change:
- contract_frozen / not_applied.
- Checkout Experience workstream consumes this contract separately.

## Checkout handoff contract

The closure output must expose:
- canonical gateway ownership matrix above;
- payment safety services are ERP-side source-of-truth gates;
- Woo remains payment capture/status surface;
- ERP fulfillment must never infer paid from fulfillment status;
- Checkout must not expose multiple normal card entry points;
- Stripe remains installed/available as hot standby; no auto retry after issuer decline;
- PayPal Card and Airwallex Card are not normal primary card UI;
- Apple Pay / Google Pay are express paths on Cart/Checkout, not Product page;
- all provider/capability decisions remain device/browser/provider-capability based.

## Production prerequisites

Static checklist only; P1.9 does not perform them:
1. backup + explicit Production schema gate for merged additive payment migrations;
2. Production code deploy gate;
3. read-only post-deploy health/closure preview;
4. separately approved historical evidence refresh/backfill if desired;
5. Checkout routing/config changes only under Checkout Experience Production gate;
6. no gateway removal until checkout regression + payment UAT are complete.

## Privacy / safety

Output must not expose:
- raw transaction id
- raw fee meta key/value payload
- customer name/email/phone/address
- gateway credentials
- provider secrets
- raw webhook payload

The service/command performs zero DB writes.

## Required tests

1. gateway ownership matrix exactly matches frozen contract.
2. closure composes health + economics using same as-of.
3. health critical => closure blocked.
4. sync stale/missing/failed => blocked.
5. scan truncation => blocked.
6. health warning/partial sync => review.
7. healthy evidence without truncation => ready.
8. known telemetry gaps do not become fabricated values.
9. actual fee coverage remains gateway × currency and no cross-currency total is created.
10. production schema/backfill/routing gates remain pending/not-applied, never implied complete.
11. JSON emits no transaction id, raw fee meta, or PII.
12. preview performs zero DB writes.
13. P1.6.1 / P1.6.2 / P1.7 / P1.8 regressions remain green.
14. command registration verified.
15. no schema/migration in P1.9.
16. no Production deploy/write/mutation.

## Delivery / UAT

Owner authorized continuous execution through UAT:
IMPLEMENT -> TEST -> COMMIT -> PUSH -> PR -> CI EVIDENCE -> MERGE WHEN SAFE/APPROVED BY THIS CONTINUOUS AUTHORIZATION -> DEV/OWNER UAT PREP

CI runner scheduling failure with runner_id=0 / steps=[] may use the already established infrastructure-exception pattern if local full validation and exact-head evidence are complete.

Stop at Owner UAT. Production is explicitly excluded.

## Implementation / Verification Evidence — 2026-09-24

- Implementation head before closure-evidence commit: 92fca44aaae3a4314d9b96e0920bd6750d8f17e5.
- Added canonical PaymentReliabilityClosureService and payments:reliability-closure command.
- Closure composes the existing PaymentHealthPreviewService and GatewayEconomicsPreviewService; no third payment calculation path was introduced.
- Frozen gateway ownership / Checkout handoff lives in config/payment_reliability.php and does not mutate gateway settings or routing.
- Runtime state is ready / review / blocked and is explicitly not Production authorization.
- Rollout gates expose payment-authority safety, Woo inbound sync, stale-payment review, economics evidence, provider telemetry coverage, Production schema, Production backfill, and Checkout routing state.
- Production schema remains pending_external; historical backfill remains not_authorized; Checkout routing remains contract_frozen_not_applied.
- Coverage gaps remain explicit: raw provider attempts, canonical webhook event store, dispute/chargeback cost, and Airwallex actual processor fee.
- No P1.9 schema/migration, scheduler, dashboard UI, Woo mutation, gateway configuration change, Production write, or deploy was added.

Validation:
- P1.9 focused closure: 10 tests / 59 assertions PASS.
- Full Payment Reliability chain P1.6.1-P1.9 + Woo/Finance/Sync: 88 tests / 473 assertions PASS.
- Finance full regression: 167 tests / 1235 assertions PASS, 1 skipped.
- Orders regression excluding inherited OrderSavedViews baseline failure: 29 tests / 96 assertions PASS.
- payments:reliability-closure command registration verified.
- JSON privacy test proves no raw transaction id, fee meta key, recipient name, phone, or email is emitted.
- Read-only closure preview proves zero DB writes.
- Gateway ownership / Checkout handoff exact-contract test PASS.
- Same-as-of composition and gateway × currency separation test PASS.
- No cross-currency amount total is emitted.
- P1.9 introduces no migration.
- New/owned files Pint PASS.
- FinanceServiceProvider Pint issue reproduces on origin/main and is inherited formatting debt.
- git diff --check PASS.
- Production deploy/write/mutation: NOT performed.

UAT target:
- One canonical read-only command: payments:reliability-closure.
- Owner UAT checks runtime state, rollout gates, gateway ownership matrix, Checkout handoff, and explicit Production prerequisites.
- Production remains outside this package even after Owner UAT PASS.
